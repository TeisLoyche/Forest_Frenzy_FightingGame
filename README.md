A personal project, just for fun. I wanted to try to make a simple game in JavaScript, in this case I chose a fighting game. 

Player 1 controls:
W (Jump)
A (Move left)
D (Move right)
SPACEBAR (Attack)

Player 2 controls: 
Arrow UP (Jump)
Arrow LEFT (Move left)
Arrow RIGHT (Move right)
Arrow DOWN (Attack) 

Have fun!
