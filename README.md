A personal project, just for fun. I wanted to try to make a simple fighting game in JavaScript.
All sprites + background were made by me, and all sounds used were downloaded royalty free from Pixabay.com
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Savages are the last survivors of a lost world, shaped by the wastelands’ brutal magic. They come to the forest not to conquer, but to steal its ancient memories, hoping to restore the knowledge of their dying people.

The Elves are cursed guardians, bound to the forest by an ancient pact. Every tree felled unravels their fragile sanity, as the forest’s magic is also their prison.

This isn’t a battle for land—it’s a struggle for memory and madness. The Savages seek the past, while the Elves fight to hold onto their fractured minds. Only one can claim the forest’s secrets.
