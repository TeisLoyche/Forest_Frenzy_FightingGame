A personal project, just for fun. I wanted to try to make a simple game in JavaScript, in this case I chose a fighting game. 
All sprites + background were made by me, and all sounds used were downloaded royalty free from Pixabay.com

Player 1 controls:

A (Move left)
D (Move right)
SPACEBAR (Attack)

Player 2 controls:

Have fun!
